<h2>Regular expression help</h2>

<p>Regular expressions are a powerful way to subset and group files.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freeformatter.com/java-regex-tester.html#documentation">Regular expression documentation</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.freeformatter.com/java-regex-tester.html">Test regular expressions</a></p>
<br>

<h3>Few important expressions</h3>
<p>"(?&lt;C&gt;)" and "(?&lt;T&gt;)" denote the channel and timepoint groups, respectively.<br></p>
<p>".*" matches anything</p>
<p>"\d+" matches a sequence of numbers, e.g. 001</p>
<br>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
Below examples are on purpose without file extensions.
The file extensions can be selected via a drop down in the "Open..." menu item and will
be added to the regular expression automatically.
</p>
<p>
Below examples work both with and without zero-padding, e.g. "T0000", "T0001" works, but also "T0", "T2", "T11" works (and will have the correct numeric-based ordering). Also, the numberings do not have to start with 0 but can also start with a higher number, e.g., 1.

    <td>Same as above but with lower case "t" such as "t0000_gfp" and "t0001_rfp"</td>

    <td>Channel and time point encoded in filenames such as "gfp_0000" and "rfp_0000". The difference to the example above is that there is no "T" in front of the time points.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="a"><b>(?&lt;C&gt;.*)/.*T(?&lt;T&gt;\d+)</b></td>
    <td>Channels are specified by subfolders and time-points are encoded in filenames such as   "gfp/T0000" and "rfp/T0000"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="a"><b>.*T(?&lt;T&gt;\d+)</b></td>
  <td>No channel grouping specified, e.g. "gpf-T0001", "gfo-T0002", etc. (in this case the name of the containing folder will be used as the channel name).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="a"><b>.*-(?&lt;T&gt;\d+)</b></td>
    <td>No channel grouping specified, and no "T" but only a dash "-" as prefix for the time points, e.g. "gfp-00", "gfp-01", etc. (in this case the name of the containing folder will be used as the channel name).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="a"><b>.*_(?&lt;T&gt;\d+)</b></td>
    <td>No channel grouping specified, and just an underscore "_" proceeding the time points, e.g. "Cam_Left_01", "Cam_Left_02", etc. (in this case the name of the containing folder will be used as the channel name).</td>
